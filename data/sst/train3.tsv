0Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .	1
100This is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio .	0

50Cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , The Full Monty , with something different .	1
50An easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .	1
100The rare movie that 's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it 's based .	1
50A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .	0
50But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .	0
100This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .	0

0One of the greatest films I 've ever seen .	0
0It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .	1
100Exceptionally well acted by Diane Lane and Richard Gere .	1
0Quite simply , a joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to .	0
50... a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance	1
